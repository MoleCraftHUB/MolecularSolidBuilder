# MacroMoleculeModeler

## Introduction

Complex organic compounds such as Coal, Coal derived pitch, petroluem derived pitch are often not suitable to study with the single representative molecular models because the average effect of experimental characterizations can tarnish the details of compounds which are collection of various molecular types and properties. To build realistic atomistic and molecular models, we need to accept the fact that these compounds are composed of wide range of molecular types and molecular weights.

The MacroMoleculeModeler code is written based on the python utilizing python API of RDKit. This code is composed of functions to conveniently construct stochastic molecular systems such as Coal and Pitch systems together with experimental charactierzations such as carbon-13 NMR, elemental composition analysis, and mass weight distributions, etc.

## Usage of the Code
